PAExec is a freely-redistributable re-implementation of 
SysInternal/Microsoft's popular PsExec program.  PAExec aims to be a drop 
in replacement for PsExec, so the command-line usage is identical, with 
additional options also supported.  This work was originally inspired by 
Talha Tariq's RemCom.

Usage: PAExec [\\computer[,computer2[,...]] | @file]
[-u user [-p psswd]|[-p@ file [-p@d]]] 
[-n s] [-l][-s|-e][-x][-i [session]][-c [-f|-v] [-csrc path]]
[-lo path][-rlo path][-ods][-w directory][-d][-<priority>][-a n,n,...]
[-dfr][-noname][-sname name][-share share_name -sharepath share_path]
[-to seconds] cmd [arguments]

Standard PAExec\PsExec command line options:

     -a         Separate processors on which the application can run with
                commas where 1 is the lowest numbered CPU. For example,
                to run the application on CPU 2 and CPU 4, enter:
                -a 2,4
                
     -c         Copy the specified program to the remote system for
                execution. If you omit this option the application
                must be in the system path on the remote system.

     -d         Don't wait for process to terminate (non-interactive).
                This option is not compatible with -to

     -e         Does not load the specified account's profile.

     -f         Copy the specified program even if the file already
                exists on the remote system.  Requires -c

     -i         Run the program so that it interacts with the desktop of the
                specified session on the specified system. If no session is
                specified the process runs in the console session. 

     -h         If the target system is Vista or higher, has the process 
                run with the account's elevated token, if available. 

     -l         [EXPERIMENTAL] Run process as limited user (strips the 
                Administrators group and allows only privileges assigned to
                the Users group). On Windows Vista the process runs with Low 
                Integrity.

     -n         Specifies timeout in seconds connecting to remote computers.

     -p         Specifies optional password for user name. If you omit this
                you will be prompted to enter a hidden password.  Also see
                -p@ and -p@d below.
     
     -s         Run the process in the System account.

     -u         Specifies optional user name for login to remote
                computer.

     -v         Copy the specified file only if it has a higher version number
                or is newer than the one on the remote system.  Requires -c

     -w         Set the working directory of the process (relative to
                remote computer).

     -x         Display the UI on the Winlogon secure desktop (Local System 
                only).  

     -<priority> Specify -low, -belownormal, -abovenormal, -high or
                -realtime to run the process at a different priority. Use
                -background to run at low memory and I/O priority on Vista.

     computer   Direct PAExec to run the application on the remote
                computer or computers specified. If you omit the computer
                name PAExec runs the application on the local system,
                and if you specify a wildcard (\\*), PAExec runs the
                command on all computers in the current domain.

     @file      PAExec will execute the command on each of the computers 
                listed in the file.

     program    Name of application to execute.

     arguments  Arguments to pass (note that file paths must be absolute 
                paths on the target system).

Additional options only available in PAExec:
    
     -cnodel   If a file is copied to the server with -c, it is normally 
               deleted (unless -d is specified).  -cnodel indicates the file 
               should not be deleted.
               
     -clist    When using -c (copy), -clist allows you to specify a text 
               file that contains a list of files to copy to the target.  
               The text file should just list file names, and the files 
               should be in the same folder as the text file.
               Example: -c -clist "C:\test path\filelist.txt"
               
               filelist.txt might contain:
               myapp.exe
               mydata.dat
               
               Myapp.exe and mydata.dat would need to be in C:\test path 
               in the example above.  
               
               IMPORTANT: The first file listed is assumed to be the one that 
               will be executed.
               
               -clist and -csrc cannot be used together.

     -csrc     When using -c (copy), -csrc allows you to specify an 
               alternate path to copy the program from.  
               Example: -c -csrc "C:\test path\file.exe"
               
     -dbg      Output to DebugView application (OutputDebugString)

     -dfr      Disable WOW64 File Redirection for the new process

     -lo       Log Output to file.  Ex: -lo C:\Temp\PAExec.log
               The file will be UTF-8 with a Byte Order Mark at the start.  

     -p@        Will read the first line of the given file and use that as the 
                password.  File should be saved as UTF-8 with or without
                Byte Order Mark.
           
     -p@d       Deletes the file specified by -p@ as soon as the password is 
                read.     

     -rlo      Remote Log Output: Log from remote service to file (on remote 
               server).  
               Ex: -rlo C:\Temp\PAExec.log
               The file will be UTF-8 with a Byte Order Mark at the start.  
               
     -to       Timeout in seconds.  The launched process must exit within this 
               number of seconds or it will be terminated.  If it is terminated, 
               the exit code will be -10
               This option is not compatible with -d
               Ex: -to 15    
               Terminate the launched process after 15 seconds if it doesn't shut down first
               
     -noname   In order to robustly handle multiple simultaneous connections to a server,
               the source server's name is added to the remote service name and remote PAExec
               executable file.  If you do NOT want this behavior, use -noname

     -sname    Remote service name.
               This option is not compatible with -noname

     -share    Remote share name.
               -sharepath must be supplied when using this functionality

     -sharepath Real path of specified remote share.
               -sharepath can only be used with -share

The application name, copy source, working directory and log file
entries can be quoted if the path contains a space.  For example:
PAExec \\test-server -w "C:\path with space" "C:\program files\app.exe"

Like PsExec, input is sent to the remote system when Enter is pressed,
and Ctrl-C stops the remote process and stops PAExec.

PsExec passes all parameters in clear-text.  In contrast, PAExec will scramble
the parameters to protect them from casual wire sniffers, but they are NOT 
encrypted.  Note that data passed between PAExec and the remote program is NOT 
scrambled or encrypted -- the same as with PsExec.

PAExec will return the error code it receives from the application that was 
launched remotely.  If PAExec itself has an error, the return code will be 
one of:

   -1 = internal error
   -2 = command line error
   -3 = failed to launch app (locally)
   -4 = failed to copy PAExec to remote (connection to ADMIN$ might have 
        failed)
   -5 = connection to server taking too long (timeout)
   -6 = PAExec service could not be installed/started on remote server
   -7 = could not communicate with remote PAExec service   
   -8 = failed to copy app to remote server
   -9 = failed to launch app (remotely)
  -10 = app was terminated after timeout expired
  -11 = forcibly stopped with Ctrl-C / Ctrl-Break
